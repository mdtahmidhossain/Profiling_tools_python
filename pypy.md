### PyPy
**PyPy** is an alternative implementation of the Python programming language that is optimized for performance, designed to run faster than the standard CPython implementation. It uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to dynamically compile the Python code to machine code, resulting in faster execution time compared to CPython. PyPy is fully compatible with the Python language and can be used as a drop-in replacement for CPython in most cases.

To **install** PyPy, you can follow the instructions for your specific operating system on the PyPy website (https://pypy.org/download.html).

To **use PyPy,** you can simply replace the command python with pypy in your terminal or command prompt. For example, instead of running a script with python script.py, you would run pypy script.py. You can also use the PyPy interpreter by typing pypy in the terminal or command prompt and entering commands one at a time.
